  The function returns an object of the real underlying ChromeOS network

  the naming in the Python interface has not been changed yet and we still
  need to use the flimflam module as the interface. The wrapping is to
  facilitate the writing of unit test and to simplify the migration to the shill
  later. Please note that this is different from the network_manager parameter
  used in the ConnectionManager and is determined only by the Python interface
