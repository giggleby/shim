# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED -- This data structure is automatically
# # generated by the tool under /src/platform/factory_keyboard_layout
# # with a corresponding image file. Please refer to png_renderer.py
# # for the usage information.

# This binding table provides the mapping from keycodes to the physical
# coordinates of key locations on the image file.
# The binding table was generated with scan codes. The scan codes are manually
# changed to keycodes by testing showkey -s and showkey -k. Also note that power
# button has different scan code from the generated one.
