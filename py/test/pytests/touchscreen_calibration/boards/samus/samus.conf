# Write the following items to sys fs before reading raw data.
# We usually need to fine tune the touch gain and threshold values.
# And sometimes, we need to tune YSIZE and the orientation.
64000081: Disable passing touch event to upper layer. This is to prevent
          undesired actions from happening on UI when touching the panel.
64001C06: Set touch gain to 6.
64001E60: Change touch threshold from 0x50 to 0x60 to prevent ghost fingers.
06000201: Baseline the sensors before lowering the test probes.
