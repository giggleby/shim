TEST LISTS
==========
On startup, goofy imports all modules in this package (except for
generic.py) in alphabetical order.  The CreateTestLists() function is
invoked in each module that has one.

generic.py is loaded *last*, and only if no other module has created
a test list called "main" (i.e., there is no board-specific test list
in the overlay).

Old-style test lists are also loaded from
/usr/local/factory/test_lists.

THE ACTIVE TEST LIST
====================
If a file called ACTIVE is present in this directory, it contains the
ID of the active test list.  So, for example, to activate the "manual_smt"
test list on a device:

  echo manual_smt > /usr/local/factory/py/test/test_lists/ACTIVE

If no ACTIVE file is present, the "main" test list is used.

(Note that ACTIVE is a file, not a symlink to a file as in the past.)
