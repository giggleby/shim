## Folder Structure

* The `backend/` folder holds the code related to the backend.
* The `frontend/` folder holds the code related to the frontend.

## System Architecture

We will create a nginx instance to serve the frontend static files. The nginx instance will
also act as a reverse proxy to direct the traffic to the backend.
